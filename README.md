Twilight is based on [Dawn](https://github.com/Shopify/dawn/), the Shopify team's very own recommended starting point for theme development.

* **Minimalist:** Uses Dawn patterns
* **Tailwind CSS:** Includes Tailwind CSS
* **CLI-enabled:** Quickly and easily use the Shopify CLI to serve and deploy your theme

## Getting started

Fork or download the theme and it's ready to go out of the box. If you want to make use of Tailwind CSS then proceed below.

## Using Tailwind CSS

Twilight will build a CSS file that contains only the necessary Talwind CSS classes.

1. Navigate to your local theme folder.
2. Simply run:
```sh
npm install
```
3. You may now serve your theme locally using the Shopify CLI while also watching for Tailwind CSS changes by running:
```sh
npm run start
```
4. Deploy/push your theme by running:
```sh
npm run deploy
```
